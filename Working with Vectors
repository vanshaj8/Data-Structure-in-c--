/*      Vectors
 
 Working with vectors
 It is like a container that store values
 No fixed length and is like a dynamic array with no inital capacity
 vector increases the capacity by 2 automatically suppose there are 2 position 
 in an vector the next value enetered would increase the size of the vector by 4 ie 2*2 times*
 It is totally different from the concept of linked lists
